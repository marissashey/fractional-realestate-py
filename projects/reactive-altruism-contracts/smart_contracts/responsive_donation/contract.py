    ResponsiveDonation Contract - MVP Version
    
    A smart contract enabling conditional charitable donations based on real-world events.
    Perfect for disaster relief, climate action, and cause-based giving.
    
    Core Features:
    1. ðŸ’° Instantaneous Donations - Direct donations with immediate payout
    2. ðŸŽ¯ Conditional Donations - "Donate $1000 to Red Cross IF hurricane hits Miami"
    3. ðŸ”® Oracle Resolution - Trusted oracles resolve event outcomes
    4. ðŸš€ Mixed Donations - Combine instant + conditional in one transaction
    5. ðŸ“Š Query Interface - Discover events and clauses
    
    Use Cases:
    - Climate disaster relief (donate if hurricane/wildfire occurs)
    - Charity matching (donate if fundraising goal is met)
    - Sports betting for good (donate to charity if team wins)
    - Political action (donate if legislation passes)
